Hi {first},

You have **{taskcount}** outstanding task(s) in TouchPoint that need your attention. These tasks involve following up with students or families in our Student Ministry.

## Why This Matters

Each task represents a student or family waiting for someone to reach out. Only one person is assigned to each task at a time - if you haven't completed it, no one has.

## Your Outstanding Tasks

{pythonscript:SM_OutstandingTasksList}

## What To Do

For each task above:

1. **Review** the task details and person information
2. **Take action** - make the call, send the text, schedule the meeting
3. **Mark complete** in TouchPoint when finished
4. **Reassign** if someone else should handle it
